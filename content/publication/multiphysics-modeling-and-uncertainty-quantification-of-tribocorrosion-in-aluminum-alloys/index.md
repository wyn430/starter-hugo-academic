abstract: Past research in tribocorrosion mainly relies on costly and
  trial-and-error experimental methods to study the materialsâ€™ deformation and
  degradation under extreme conditions. This work developed a finite element
  based multiphysics model, validated by existing tribocorrosion experiments of
  two Al alloys, to analyze the synergistic effects of mechanical and corrosion
  properties on the material degradation mechanisms of tribocorrosion. During
  consecutive passes of the counter body, significant residual stress was found
  to develop near the edge of the wear track, leading to highly concentrated
  corrosion current than elsewhere. Such non-uniform surface corrosion and
  stress-corrosion coupling led to variations of tribocorrosion rate over time,
  even though testing conditions were kept constant. Tribocorrosion rate maps
  were generated to predict material loss as a function of different mechanical
  and electrochemical properties, indicating a hard, complaint metal with high
  anodic Tafel slope and low exchange current density is most resistant to
  tribocorrosion. Finally, two surrogate models, Gaussian process and neural
  network with dropout, were used for uncertainty quantification of the finite
  element model.
