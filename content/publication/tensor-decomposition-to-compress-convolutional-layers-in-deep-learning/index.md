abstract: "Feature extraction for tensor data serves as an important step in
  many tasks such as anomaly detection, process monitoring, image
  classification, and quality control. Although many methods have been proposed
  for tensor feature extraction, there are still two challenges that need to be
  addressed: (i) how to reduce the computation cost for high dimensional and
  large volume tensor data; (ii) how to interpret the output features and
  evaluate their significance. The most recent methods in deep learning, such as
  Convolutional Neural Network, have shown outstanding performance in analyzing
  tensor data, but their wide adoption is still hindered by model complexity and
  lack of interpretability. To fill this research gap, we propose to use
  CP-decomposition to approximately compress the convolutional layer (CPAC-Conv
  layer) in deep learning. The contributions of our work include three aspects:
  (i) we adapt CP-decomposition to compress convolutional kernels and derive the
  expressions of forward and backward propagations for our proposed CPAC-Conv
  layer; (ii) compared with the original convolutional layer, the proposed
  CPAC-Conv layer can reduce the number of parameters without decaying
  prediction performance. It can combine with other layers to build novel Deep
  Neural Networks; (iii) the value of decomposed kernels indicates the
  significance of the corresponding feature map, which provides us with insights
  to guide feature selection."
