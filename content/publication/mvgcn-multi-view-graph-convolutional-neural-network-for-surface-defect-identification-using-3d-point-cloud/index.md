abstract: "Surface defect identification is a crucial task in many manufacturing
  systems, including automotive, aircraft, and steel rolling. Although
  image-based surface defect identification methods have been proposed, these
  methods usually have two limitations: images may lose partial information,
  such as depths of surface defects; and their precision is vulnerable to many
  factors, such as the inspection angle, light, color, noise, etc. Given that
  three dimensional (3D) point cloud can precisely represent the
  multi-dimensional structure of surface defects, we aim to detect and classify
  surface defects using 3D point cloud. This has two major challenges: (i) the
  defects are often sparsely distributed over the surface, which makes their
  features prone to be hidden by the normal surface; (ii) different permutations
  and transformations of 3D point cloud may represent the same surface, so the
  proposed model needs to be permutation and transformation invariant. In this
  paper, a two-step surface defect identification approach is developed to
  investigate the defects' patterns in 3D point cloud data. The proposed
  approach consists of an unsupervised method for defect detection and a
  multi-view deep learning model for defect classification, which can keep track
  of the features from both defective and non-defective regions. We prove that
  the proposed approach is invariant to different permutations and
  transformations. A case study is conducted for defect identification in the
  aircraft fuselage. The results show that our approach receives the best defect
  detection and classification accuracy compared with other benchmark methods. "
