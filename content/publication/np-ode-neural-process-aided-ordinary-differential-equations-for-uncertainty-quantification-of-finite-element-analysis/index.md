abstract: "Finite Element Analysis (FEA) has been widely used to generate
  simulations of complex nonlinear systems. Despite its strength and accuracy,
  FEA usually has two limitations: (i) running high-fidelity FEA often requires
  high computational cost and consumes a large amount of time; (ii) FEA is a
  deterministic method that is insufficient for uncertainty quantification when
  modeling complex systems with various types of uncertainties. In this article,
  a physics-informed data-driven surrogate model, named Neural Process Aided
  Ordinary Differential Equation (NP-ODE), is proposed to model the FEA
  simulations and capture both input and output uncertainties. To validate the
  advantages of the proposed NP-ODE, we conduct experiments on both the
  simulation data generated from a given ordinary differential equation and the
  data collected from a real FEA platform for tribocorrosion. The results show
  that the proposed NP-ODE outperforms benchmark methods. The NP-ODE method
  realizes the smallest predictive error as well as generating the most
  reasonable confidence intervals with the best coverage on testing data points.
  Appendices, code, and data are available in the supplementary files."
