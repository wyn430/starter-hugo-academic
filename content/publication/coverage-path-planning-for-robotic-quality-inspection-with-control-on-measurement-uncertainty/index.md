abstract: The optical scanning gauges mounted on the robots are commonly used in
  quality inspection, such as verifying the dimensional specification of sheet
  structures. Coverage path planning (CPP) significantly influences the accuracy
  and efficiency of robotic quality inspection. Traditional CPP strategies focus
  on minimizing the number of viewpoints or traveling distance of robots under
  the condition of full coverage inspection. The measurement uncertainty when
  collecting the scanning data is less considered in the free-form surface
  inspection. To address this problem, a novel CPP method with the optimal
  viewpoint sampling strategy is proposed to incorporate the measurement
  uncertainty of key measurement points (MPs) into free-form surface inspection.
  At first, the feasible ranges of measurement uncertainty are calculated based
  on the tolerance specifications of the MPs. The initial feasible viewpoint set
  is generated considering the measurement uncertainty and the visibility of
  MPs. Then, the inspection cost function is built to evaluate the number of
  selected viewpoints and the average measurement uncertainty in the field of
  views of all the selected viewpoints. Afterward, an enhanced rapidly exploring
  random tree algorithm is proposed for viewpoint sampling using the inspection
  cost function and CPP optimization. Case studies, including simulation tests
  and inspection experiments, have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness
  of the proposed method. Results show that the scanning precision of key MPs is
  significantly improved compared with the benchmark method.
