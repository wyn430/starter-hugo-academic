abstract: "This paper presents the use of a structured-light three-dimensional
  scanner to allow for efficient and real-time inspections of precast concrete
  specimens. This proposed quality assurance system reviews the quality of a
  product in three key features: overall dimensions, embedded locations, and
  surface finishes. The experimental program demonstrated that the proposed
  quality assurance system can quantitatively measure the surface finish of a
  precast concrete object, recognize and check the location of the embedded
  metal parts, and validate the overall geometry with the design."
